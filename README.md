I am Data scientist at the Forest bank, and the bank has been facing a number of fraudulent transactions. 
Fradulent transaction are those which are not done by the user itself but by a hacker or by a card thief or by doing a fishing attack. 
The bank has a huge dataset of it's credit card users and the bank has also done the job of marking these transactions as fraudulent or not. 
Being banks' Data science expert have been given the task to first analyse this data and generate insights and then predict if a transaction on a credit card is going to be fraud or not.
Using classification alorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM, I had made predictions.
